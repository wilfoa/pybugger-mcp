# User Story: Python Debug Relay Server

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 13, 2026  
**Status:** Discovery Phase  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic:** AI-Assisted Development Tooling

---

## Executive Summary

Build a robust HTTP relay server that enables AI coding agents to perform full interactive debugging of Python applications. The server bridges the gap between non-interactive command execution and interactive debugging by exposing debugpy/DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) functionality via REST endpoints.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Gap

AI coding agents (Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc.) have transformed software development by reading code, executing commands, and analyzing output. However, a critical capability gap exists: **interactive debugging**.

### Current State

| Capability | AI Agents Today |
|------------|-----------------|
| Read source code | Yes |
| Execute shell commands | Yes |
| See command output | Yes |
| Set breakpoints | No |
| Inspect runtime state | No |
| Step through code | No |
| Evaluate expressions at runtime | No |

### Root Cause

Traditional debuggers (pdb, debugpy, gdb) require:
- **Continuous interactive sessions** - Agents execute discrete commands
- **Bidirectional stdin/stdout** - Agents have unidirectional command execution
- **Stateful connections** - Agents are stateless between invocations

### Impact

Without debugging capabilities, AI agents must:
- Rely on print statement debugging (slow, pollutes code)
- Make educated guesses about runtime state
- Ask users to manually debug and report findings
- Miss subtle bugs that only manifest at runtime

### Opportunity

By creating an HTTP bridge to debugpy, we enable AI agents to:
- Set breakpoints and pause execution at precise locations
- Inspect variable values and object state at runtime
- Step through code to understand execution flow
- Evaluate expressions in the current execution context
- Debug complex multi-file applications systematically

---

## 2. User Personas

### Primary Persona: AI Coding Agent

**Name:** Agent Claude  
**Type:** AI-powered coding assistant  
**Environment:** CLI tool, IDE extension, or web interface

**Characteristics:**
- Executes discrete bash/shell commands
- Cannot maintain persistent interactive sessions
- Processes structured data (JSON) efficiently
- Has no native GUI or visual interface
- Operates with HTTP client capabilities

**Goals:**
- Debug Python scripts to find root cause of bugs
- Inspect runtime state without modifying source code
- Step through complex logic to understand behavior
- Validate fixes by observing execution

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot use pdb or IDE debuggers interactively
- Must ask humans to debug and report back
- Print-debugging requires code changes and cleanup
- Guessing at runtime state leads to incorrect fixes

**Technical Requirements:**
- RESTful API with JSON payloads
- Synchronous request/response (no WebSockets required for MVP)
- Clear error messages for self-correction
- Stateless requests (session state managed server-side)

---

### Secondary Persona: Automation Developer

**Name:** Dana DevOps  
**Role:** Developer automating debug workflows  
**Environment:** CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, custom tooling

**Characteristics:**
- Writes Python/Bash scripts for automation
- Integrates tools via APIs
- Values scriptability over GUIs
- Needs reproducible debugging sessions

**Goals:**

- Debug across SSH tunnels
- Maintain debugging context across reconnects

**Pain Points:**
- IDE remote debugging is complex to configure
- Container debugging requires special setup
- Losing debugging context on disconnection
- Port forwarding complexity

---

## 3. User Flows

### 3.1 Happy Path: Basic Debug Session

```
Start Session --> Set Breakpoints --> Launch Script --> Hit Breakpoint --> Inspect State --> Step Through --> Continue --> Session Ends
```

**Detailed Flow:**

| Step | Action | API Call | Expected Response |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Create debug session | `POST /sessions` | `{session_id: "abc123", status: "created"}` |
| 2 | Set breakpoint | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` | `{breakpoint_id: "bp1", verified: true}` |
| 3 | Launch script | `POST /sessions/{id}/launch` | `{status: "running"}` |
| 4 | Check status (poll) | `GET /sessions/{id}/status` | `{status: "paused", reason: "breakpoint", location: {...}}` |
| 5 | Get stack trace | `GET /sessions/{id}/stacktrace` | `{frames: [...]}` |
| 6 | Get variables | `GET /sessions/{id}/frames/{fid}/variables` | `{variables: [...]}` |
| 7 | Evaluate expression | `POST /sessions/{id}/evaluate` | `{result: "value", type: "str"}` |
| 8 | Step over | `POST /sessions/{id}/step-over` | `{status: "paused", location: {...}}` |
| 9 | Continue | `POST /sessions/{id}/continue` | `{status: "running"}` |
| 10 | Check completion | `GET /sessions/{id}/status` | `{status: "terminated", exit_code: 0}` |
| 11 | Clean up | `DELETE /sessions/{id}` | `{deleted: true}` |

---

### 3.2 Alternative Flow: Attach to Running Process

**Scenario:** Debug an already-running Python application (e.g., web server, long-running job)

```
Find Process --> Attach Session --> Set Breakpoints --> Trigger Behavior --> Debug --> Detach
```

| Step | Action | API Call |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | List debuggable processes | `GET /processes` |
| 2 | Create attach session | `POST /sessions` with `{mode: "attach", pid: 1234}` |
| 3 | Verify attachment | `GET /sessions/{id}/status` |
| 4 | Set breakpoints | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` |
| 5 | Wait for breakpoint (user triggers app behavior) | Poll `GET /sessions/{id}/status` |
| 6 | Debug as normal | Various debug endpoints |
| 7 | Detach cleanly | `POST /sessions/{id}/detach` |

**Prerequisites:**
- Target process must have debugpy installed
- Process must be started with `--listen` flag OR accept attach request

---

### 3.3 Alternative Flow: Debug with Arguments and Environment

**Scenario:** Debug a script that requires command-line arguments and environment variables

```python
# Example: python train.py --epochs 10 --data ./data.csv
```

| Step | API Call | Payload |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Create session | `POST /sessions` |
| 2 | Configure launch | `POST /sessions/{id}/launch` | `{script: "train.py", args: ["--epochs", "10", "--data", "./data.csv"], env: {"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES": "0"}, cwd: "/project"}` |

---

### 3.4 Alternative Flow: Debug Unit Tests

**Scenario:** Debug a specific test function in pytest

| Step | Action | API Call |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create session | `POST /sessions` |
| 2 | Set breakpoint in test | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` with `{file: "test_math.py", line: 42}` |
| 3 | Launch pytest | `POST /sessions/{id}/launch` with `{module: "pytest", args: ["-xvs", "test_math.py::test_divide"]}` |
| 4 | Debug when breakpoint hits | Normal debug flow |

---

### 3.5 Alternative Flow: Conditional Breakpoints

**Scenario:** Break only when a specific condition is met

```python
# Break only when i > 100 in a loop
for i in range(1000):
    process(i)  # Breakpoint here, but only when i > 100
```

| Step | API Call | Payload |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Set conditional breakpoint | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` | `{file: "main.py", line: 3, condition: "i > 100"}` |
| 2 | Set hit count breakpoint | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` | `{file: "main.py", line: 3, hit_condition: "== 50"}` |
| 3 | Set log point (no break) | `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` | `{file: "main.py", line: 3, log_message: "i = {i}"}` |

---

### 3.6 Error Flow: Script Crashes with Exception

```
Launch --> Script Raises Exception --> Capture State --> Inspect --> Terminate
```

| Step | Status Response | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | `{status: "running"}` | Script executing |
| 2 | `{status: "paused", reason: "exception", exception: {type: "ValueError", message: "...", location: {...}}}` | Exception caught |
| 3 | Agent calls `/stacktrace`, `/variables` | Inspect crash state |
| 4 | Agent calls `/evaluate` | Check values that caused crash |
| 5 | `DELETE /sessions/{id}` | Clean up |

**Configuration:** `POST /sessions/{id}/launch` with `{stop_on_exception: true}` or `{stop_on_exception: "uncaught"}` (only uncaught exceptions)

---

### 3.7 Error Flow: Invalid Breakpoint Location

| Scenario | API Response | Agent Action |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| File doesn't exist | `{error: "file_not_found", file: "/path/to/missing.py"}` | Check file path |
| Line is blank/comment | `{breakpoint_id: "bp1", verified: false, message: "No executable code at line 5"}` | Adjust line number |
| Line doesn't exist | `{error: "invalid_line", line: 999, max_line: 150}` | Fix line number |
| Syntax error in condition | `{error: "invalid_condition", details: "SyntaxError: ..."}` | Fix condition |

---

### 3.8 Error Flow: Session Timeout

**Scenario:** Session inactive for extended period

| Time | Event | Response |
|------|-------|----------|
| T+0 | Session created | Normal |
| T+30min | No activity, warning | Session metadata: `{warning: "Session will expire in 30 minutes"}` |
| T+60min | Session timeout | Session terminated, status: `{status: "terminated", reason: "timeout"}` |
| T+60min+ | Any request to session | `{error: "session_not_found", id: "abc123"}` |

**Configuration:** Timeout configurable via `POST /sessions` with `{timeout_minutes: 120}` or server config.

---

### 3.9 Error Flow: Connection Issues

| Scenario | HTTP Status | Response | Recovery |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Server not running | Connection refused | N/A | Start relay server |
| Session crashed | 500 | `{error: "session_crashed", details: "..."}` | Create new session |
| Debug target died | 200 | `{status: "terminated", reason: "target_exited", exit_code: 1}` | Review output, relaunch |
| debugpy timeout | 504 | `{error: "debugpy_timeout", operation: "evaluate"}` | Retry or terminate |

---

## 4. Edge Cases

### 4.1 Script with Syntax Errors

**Scenario:** User tries to debug a script with Python syntax errors.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Launch fails immediately
- Response includes syntax error details with file, line, and offset
- Session remains in "created" state (can fix and retry)

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "syntax_error",
  "details": {
    "file": "/path/to/script.py",
    "line": 15,
    "offset": 23,
    "message": "unexpected EOF while parsing",
    "text": "if x == 1"
  }
}
```

---

### 4.2 Breakpoint in Non-Existent File

**Scenario:** Breakpoint set in file path that doesn't exist or is inaccessible.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Breakpoint creation succeeds but marked as unverified
- Warning returned to agent
- If file appears later (created/mounted), breakpoint auto-verifies

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "breakpoint_id": "bp_123",
  "verified": false,
  "message": "Source file not found. Breakpoint pending.",
  "file": "/path/to/missing.py",
  "line": 10
}
```

---

### 4.3 Multiple Simultaneous Breakpoint Hits (Threading)

**Scenario:** Multi-threaded script hits breakpoints in multiple threads simultaneously.

**Expected Behavior:**
- All threads pause when any breakpoint hit (default)
- Status endpoint returns all stopped threads
- Agent can inspect/control each thread independently
- Configuration option for "stop all" vs "stop only hitting thread"

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "paused",
  "reason": "breakpoint",
  "stopped_threads": [
    {"thread_id": 1, "name": "MainThread", "breakpoint_id": "bp_1", "location": {...}},
    {"thread_id": 2, "name": "Worker-1", "breakpoint_id": "bp_2", "location": {...}}
  ],
  "all_threads": [
    {"thread_id": 1, "name": "MainThread", "status": "paused"},
    {"thread_id": 2, "name": "Worker-1", "status": "paused"},
    {"thread_id": 3, "name": "Worker-2", "status": "paused"}
  ]
}
```

**Thread-specific operations:**
- `POST /sessions/{id}/threads/{tid}/continue` - Resume single thread
- `GET /sessions/{id}/threads/{tid}/stacktrace` - Thread-specific stack

---

### 4.4 Very Long-Running Scripts

**Scenario:** Script runs for hours (e.g., ML training, data processing).

**Considerations:**
- Session must not timeout during legitimate long runs
- Breakpoint management must work while running
- Pause-on-demand functionality needed
- Output buffering must not consume unlimited memory

**Handling:**
- Heartbeat mechanism: `GET /sessions/{id}/ping` resets timeout
- Activity detection: Any debug operation resets timeout
- Output streaming: `GET /sessions/{id}/output?since=cursor` with pagination
- Memory limits: Output buffer capped (configurable), older entries dropped
- Pause anytime: `POST /sessions/{id}/pause` works on running script

---

### 4.5 Scripts Spawning Subprocesses

**Scenario:** Main script spawns child processes (subprocess, multiprocessing).

**Expected Behavior (MVP):**
- Child processes NOT automatically debugged
- Clear documentation of limitation
- Main process debugging unaffected

**Future Enhancement:**
- `POST /sessions/{id}/launch` with `{debug_subprocesses: true}`
- Child processes connect to relay automatically
- Unified session manages all processes

**API Response (when subprocess detected):**
```json
{
  "event": "subprocess_spawned",
  "pid": 12345,
  "debuggable": false,
  "message": "Subprocess spawned but not attached. Enable debug_subprocesses for child debugging."
}
```

---

### 4.6 Scripts Requiring User Input (stdin)

**Scenario:** Script calls `input()` or reads from stdin.

**Handling Options:**

1. **Provide input via API:**
```json
POST /sessions/{id}/stdin
{"input": "user response\n"}
```

2. **Pre-configure inputs:**
```json
POST /sessions/{id}/launch
{"stdin_inputs": ["response1", "response2"]}
```

3. **Status indication:**
```json
{
  "status": "waiting_for_input",
  "prompt": "Enter your name: "
}
```

---

### 4.7 Large Variable Inspection (Huge Data Structures)

**Scenario:** Variable is a massive DataFrame, list with millions of items, or deeply nested object.

**Handling:**
- **Lazy loading:** Only return top-level structure initially
- **Pagination:** `GET /sessions/{id}/frames/{fid}/variables/{var_id}/children?offset=0&limit=100`
- **Truncation:** String values truncated with indicator
- **Summary mode:** `GET /sessions/{id}/frames/{fid}/variables?summary=true` returns type/size only

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "large_list",
  "type": "list",
  "length": 1000000,
  "value": "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (1000000 items)]",
  "truncated": true,
  "expandable": true,
  "variable_reference": 12345
}
```

**Expansion request:**
```json
GET /sessions/{id}/variables/12345?start=0&count=50

{
  "items": [
    {"index": 0, "value": "...", "type": "..."},
    {"index": 1, "value": "...", "type": "..."},
    ...
  ],
  "total": 1000000,
  "has_more": true
}
```

---

### 4.8 Circular References in Objects

**Scenario:** Object contains circular reference (e.g., parent-child, graph nodes).

**Handling:**
- Detect circular references during serialization
- Replace with reference marker
- Provide variable_reference for navigation

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "node",
  "type": "TreeNode",
  "properties": [
    {"name": "value", "value": "root", "type": "str"},
    {"name": "parent", "value": "<circular: node>", "type": "TreeNode", "circular": true},
    {"name": "children", "type": "list", "length": 3, "expandable": true}
  ]
}
```

---

### 4.9 Additional Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| **Script modifies its own source** | Breakpoints remain at original lines; warning issued |
| **Debugger step into C extension** | Step completes, marked as "native frame" |
| **Recursive function (deep stack)** | Stack trace paginated, depth limit configurable |
| **Script changes working directory** | Relative paths resolved from original cwd |
| **Multiple Python versions** | Session specifies Python interpreter path |
| **Virtual environment** | Launch config includes venv activation |
| **Script with very fast breakpoint** | Ensure pause happens before response returns |
| **Unicode in variable names/values** | Full UTF-8 support, proper JSON encoding |
| **Binary data in variables** | Base64 encoded with metadata |
| **Exception in __repr__** | Fallback to type/id display |

- [ ] **AC-EC-2:** Step Over advances to next line without entering function calls
- [ ] **AC-EC-3:** Step Into enters function call on current line
- [ ] **AC-EC-4:** Step Out completes current function and pauses at caller
- [ ] **AC-EC-5:** Pause stops running program within 1 second
- [ ] **AC-EC-6:** All step operations return new location in response

### 7.5 State Inspection

## 8. Out of Scope (v1)

The following features are explicitly **NOT** included in v1:

### 8.1 Definitely Out

| Feature | Reason | Future Version |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **WebSocket/real-time events** | Polling sufficient for MVP; adds complexity | v2 |
| **GUI/Web dashboard** | Agent-first; GUIs can be built on API later | v2+ |
| **Remote debugging (non-localhost)** | Security implications; requires auth | v2 |
| **Multi-language support** | Python-only focus for v1 | v3+ |
| **Profiling/performance analysis** | Separate concern from debugging | v2+ |
| **Memory debugging/leak detection** | Specialized tooling needed | v3+ |
| **Distributed debugging** | Complex; needs design | v3+ |
| **IDE plugins** | API is the interface; plugins can be built later | Community |
| **Hot code reloading** | Complex Python feature | v3+ |
| **Time-travel debugging** | Requires execution recording | v3+ |

### 8.2 Simplified for v1

| Feature | v1 Behavior | Full Behavior (Later) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Subprocess debugging** | Main process only | All child processes |
| **Thread control** | Stop all threads | Per-thread control |
| **Async debugging** | Basic support | Full coroutine inspection |
| **Just My Code** | Debug all code | Filter out library code |
| **Authentication** | None (localhost only) | API keys, OAuth |
| **Rate limiting** | None | Configurable limits |
| **Metrics/observability** | Basic health endpoint | Full OpenTelemetry |

### 8.3 Assumptions for v1

1. **One Python version per session** - No mixed-version debugging
2. **Local filesystem access** - Script files must be on same machine as relay
3. **Standard Python** - CPython only, no PyPy/Jython
4. **Single machine** - Debug target and relay on same host
5. **No container awareness** - Works in containers but not container-specific features

## 10. Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Owner | Status |
|---|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Should sessions auto-save state for resume after relay crash? | Reliability | TBD | Open |
| 2 | What's the maximum reasonable number of concurrent sessions? | Resource planning | TBD | Open |
| 3 | Should we support debugpy's "just my code" feature in v1? | Scope | TBD | Open |
| 4 | How should we handle very large output (>100MB)? | Memory | TBD | Open |
| 5 | Should breakpoint persistence be per-project or global? | UX | TBD | Open |
